It's a bit tricky because there are evidently people out there who think that ""sacking out"" a horse means to terrify it, and who ""throw down a horse"" as some means of establishing dominance instead of doing what Rarey was doing with his technique. (I've heard nice people make caustic comments on these variants of Rarey's methods, comments that would probably lead others to think that Rarey was an abusive trainer.)  And somebody will likely insist that the new article should not represent the single POV that it is good to be humane when ""breaking"" horses. (Somebody once wrote that if I didn't believe in bronc busting I should educate myself by going to a rodeo or two. I think that person totally misunderstands the sport, but anyway...) I think that I took some of the information left over from the original ""horse breaking"" article and put it in a sort of a stub and a half for such an article. That writer also had some ideas about Roberts's methods that I thought were probably wrong because I hadn't read them in his stuff, but then I haven't necessarily read and/or remembered everything that Roberts has written. The best I have been able to do with the ""non-humane methods"" category is to state that there are people who clearly are using these methods, but that they seem not to be getting books published.

102,"I haven't even got halfway through this yet, and I've lost count of the things that bother me. It could really stand to be mostly re-written. But I got to the part about unsynchronized transmissions, and I had to say something. First, ALL transmissions were unsynchronized until not that long ago, relatively speaking, on cars, trucks, and tractors. No one was expected to bring their Model A to a stop before shifting; it wouldn't work. If one was expected to know how to double clutch just to drive a car, then doing so on a tractor would be no great mystery. Second, and more importantly, it's not EVERY TIME you need to shift...it's every time you need to DOWNSHIFT. It is not hard to shift an un-synchronized transmission from 2nd into 3rd, because the internals naturally slow down once you let off the gas. However, when one wants to downshift, they need to SPEED UP the spinning internals to match the speed of the next lowest gear. That is the entire point behind synchros...they automatically match the rotating speeds of the shafts and dog clutches. They aren't necessary for upshifting (although they can help make the shifts faster). If you understand how a transmission works, this is very obvious. Try shifting your modern car without using the clutch; it's far easier to go from 3rd to 4th than from 3rd to 2nd. In order to get it into second, you usually will have to hit the gas, and bring the engine/input shaft RPM's up until the match the speed of the 2nd gear dog clutch. When going from 3rd to 4th, you simply have to let off the gas, and the trans will slow down of its own accord, until the dog clutch and shaft are spinning at the same speed. So, even if one DID have to ""stop to shift"" a tractor, it would only be, for example, if you tried to take a hill in 4th gear, and found yourself lugging down. In that case, if you didn't want to try to double clutch, you'd bring it to a stop, start out in first again, and then make your way back up to 3rd gear. Otherwise, what are you supposed to do? Start out in 3rd gear on a hill? Stay in 1st gear the entire time? Obviously, you would only have to stop if you wanted to DOWNSHIFT, which is VERY different from saying that you ""had to stop every time you wanted to shift"". How the hell would you even get into 4th gear to NEED to downshift? Did you just start out in 4th gear, or what?.45Colt 04:35, 12 October 2015 (UTC)",-1,havent even get halfway yet ive lose count thing bother could really stand mostly rewrite get part unsynchronized transmission say something first transmission unsynchronized long ago relatively speak car truck tractor one expect bring model stop shift wouldnt work one expect know double clutch drive car tractor would great mystery second importantly every time need shiftits every time need downshift hard shift unsynchronized transmission 2nd 3rd internals naturally slow let gas however one want downshift need speed spin internals match speed next low gear entire point behind synchrosthey automatically match rotate speed shaft dog clutch arent necessary upshifting although help make shift faster understand transmission work obvious try shift modern car without use clutch far easy go 3rd 4th 3rd 2nd order get second usually hit gas bring engineinput shaft rpm match speed 2nd gear dog clutch go 3rd 4th simply let gas trans slow accord dog clutch shaft spin speed even one stop shift tractor would example try take hill 4th gear found lug case didnt want try double clutch youd bring stop start first make way back 3rd gear otherwise suppose start 3rd gear hill stay 1st gear entire time obviously would stop want downshift different say stop every time want shift hell would even get 4th gear need downshift start 4th gear what45colt 0435 12 october 2015 utc,havent even got halfway yet ive lost count thing bother could realli stand mostli rewritten got part unsynchron transmiss say someth first transmiss unsynchron long ago rel speak car truck tractor one expect bring model stop shift wouldnt work one expect know doubl clutch drive car tractor would great mysteri second importantli everi time need shiftit everi time need downshift hard shift unsynchron transmiss 2nd 3rd intern natur slow let ga howev one want downshift need speed spin intern match speed next lowest gear entir point behind synchrosthey automat match rotat speed shaft dog clutch arent necessari upshift although help make shift faster understand transmiss work obviou tri shift modern car without use clutch far easier go 3rd 4th 3rd 2nd order get second usual hit ga bring engineinput shaft rpm match speed 2nd gear dog clutch go 3rd 4th simpli let ga tran slow accord dog clutch shaft spin speed even one stop shift tractor would exampl tri take hill 4th gear found lug case didnt want tri doubl clutch youd bring stop start first make way back 3rd gear otherwis suppos start 3rd gear hill stay 1st gear entir time obvious would stop want downshift differ say stop everi time want shift hell would even get 4th gear need downshift start 4th gear what45colt 0435 12 octob 2015 utc,-0.8187,-0.8756,-1,-1

== Improper user page ==

You're the first admin on the list, so I'll ask you about this.  User:Roulette36 has a user page that is racist and offensive.  It consists of a single sentence: ""Mexicans are dirty.""  I have advised him that this does not conform to wikipedia policy.  If he does not change it, or changes it back, can you please block him or advise me of who I should ask for further action.  Thanks.  --Tjss 00:20, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

:Hello! I see that you have already blanked the offending comment from the user-in-questions' page.  Wikipedia:User_page#What_can_I_not_have_on_my_user_page.3F shows  that polemical comments should be avoided & WP:CIVIL and Wikipedia:No personal attacks stress that attacks on third parties should be avoided and that good Wikipedians remove them on sight. If the offending remarks are replaced, the user can be warned with the various policies pointed out.  If they persist then a block request can be made to an administrator with the repeat offence evidence as a demonstration of the requirement. Regards,  05:47, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

::In that case, I would like to officially request that User:Roulette36 be blocked.  After reviewing his contribs, he appears to have thirteen instances of vandalism since 12 February 2006, most of them including racist remarks, especially towards African Americans.  I note that on his talk page, he has been warned three times by different users that his actions constitute vandalism, and was threatened with blockage on Feb 13.  This user shows nothing but indifference to wikipedia policy and general sensitivity.  --Tjss 05:57, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

:I have left a message on Roulette36's userpage to say that his next vandal effort will be his last.  The user appears to edit infrequently on Wikipedia, so I prefer to give them a chance of redemption rather than to block in absentia. Regards,  06:22, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

== Facial motion capture ==

One of our competitors is now trying to erase us from Wiki pages which I contribute to for admittedly business-related purposes, but also to balance the information here. I have worked hard to make sure that even our competition is fairly represented and tried to clean up the entire article not just the 3 paragraphs where I try to encapsulate our new technology. As you may or may not remember you made some redirections, which I didn't complain about, as that makes sense. Claiming we are unfairly advertising because we are pointing out advantages in better technology is a fine line I'd appreciate assistance in navigating.

The fact they only edited anonymously two of the pages I work on gives me some sense of who they are, but I'd like to avoid the whole battle if possible. Please let me know your thoughts. Tmcsheery 16:26, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

:I have no idea what you are talking about! Can you please place a link to the article title under discussion in the title of this series of exchanges, please? ""Truth verses reality"" tells me nothing.  16:36, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

:Ah, a search on your Talk page reveals the above article from several weeks ago. OK, to avoid appearing partisan in any discussion of technology or abilities of companies in the same field, I would discuss these in equal depth, using a neutral tone of voice and at all times avoiding the implication we are better than the competition.  Comments such as ""Disclosure: PhaseSpace markers are even more cumbersome..."" and ""This technology will likely be the winner in a few years..."" should be avoided as they are derogatory and speculative respectively.  A better approach would be to create a comparative list of the technologies, listing their advantages and disadvantages in a dispassionate voice.  Are there only two facial motion capture technologies in existence in 2006?  A side-by-side comparison would be in order if this is so.  If there are more, perhaps a matrix could be used, demonstrating the potential applications for each technology - are there places where one would be better than the other?  Remember, a researcher just wants factual information served in an efficient manner. Don't draw conclusions for them, as an article that tells you what to think instead of letting you either make your own mind up or giving you further avenues for exploration of the topic is a bad article.

:I can't blame an interested party using/selling the alternative technology from yours from wanting to edit the article as it stands; something that put me in a bad light when I am trying to earn a living wouldn't go down too well here!  Your article shouldn't read like an advert for one technology or a polemic against the other.  Advertising is frowned upon in Wikipedia, as it demonstrates a biased point of view.  If you can discuss both companies' products without favouring one over the other, then this would be the better course to take. If you feel that you can't see the benefits of theirs and the restrictions of your own product, then it would be best to leave the article in the hands of other editors who have no interest in the success or failure of your respective business ventures.  The market will see to it who is successful.  Remember, you may have started the article about your own product, but you don't own the article - it belongs to every editor and reader and their edits are as inherently valid as your own, unless they are obviously vandals.

:If you want to develop the article in a private sandbox then please do so.  I would be happy to offer more constructive criticism if-and-when you decide to show me the revised version. Regards,  17:02, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

Update: After I reverted the article http://en.wikipedia.org./wiki/Motion_capture the same anonymous location added more derogotory verbage which I actually don't care about and then added more promotional materials for their product, (making it pretty clear who it is) which I also don't care about, just as long as they don't delete us entirely. On the other I'll get rid of the speculative side. I put in the disclosure so I don't have a problem with putting down our technology. Tmcsheery 23:16, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

Also, please include a link to the article upon which you are commenting - the AfD - rather than making an abstract remark.  It seems a bit appropos de rein to see a comment about a surprising subject on my Talk page out-of-context! Regards,  05:48, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

:: re the signature: I can say only, ""ack!"" If you put the wrong number of tildes, then it only timestamps. (Oh, and it's spelled ""apropos de rien"" - ""rein"" is French for kidney.) DS 12:29, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

:That's a great mistake of mine, thanks for pointing it out to me! :-) I'll have to use it at work sometime. So two tildes only gives a timestamp; three for a name tag and four for both?  There's my new thing of the day learned! Best wishes,  15:22, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

==VandalProof 1.2 Now Available==

180px 
After a lenghty, but much-needed Wikibreak, I'm happy to announce that version 1.2 of VandalProof is now available for download! Beyond fixing some of the most obnoxious bugs, like the persistent crash on start-up that many have experienced, version 1.2 also offers a wide variety of new features, including a stub-sorter, a global user whitelist and blacklist, navigational controls, and greater customization. You can find a full list of the new features here. While I believe this release to be a significant improvement over the last, it's nonetheless nowhere near the end of the line for VandalProof. Thanks to Rob Church, I now have an account on  with SysOp rights and have already been hard at work incorporating administrative tools into VandalProof, which I plan to make available in the near future. An example of one such SysOp tool that I'm working on incorporating is my simple history merge tool, which simplifies the process of performing history merges from one article into another. Anyway, if you haven't already, I'd encourage you to download and install version 1.2 and take it out for a test-drive. As always, your suggestions for improvement are always appreciated, and I hope that you will find this new version useful. Happy editing! --AmiDaniel (talk) 02:02, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

The article was in the main article space rather than in the User space, so I transferred the data to the appropriate space, your userpage.  15:33, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

:Ok I tried to point it out to you. Could you please restore my user talk page, that was created in the wrong user space ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=&user=&page=Talk%3ABenutzer%3AChrislb])? Didn't know it's so hard to understand. --chrislb é—®é˘ 20:58, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

Your user Talk page is restored, as requested in your last message.  Your previous communications haven't requested this, referring to the user page that was created in the main article space, so lack of understanding shouldn't be construed.  21:07, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

== Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Allan Whitwell ==

Hi there. I thought you might want to take a look again at this AfD discussion and see if your view on the matter has changed. Regards, --BillC 22:06, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

== Chop-chop ==

You speedy deleted Chop-chop before I'd even had a chance to reload the page after creating it! I want it to redirect to Chop Chop, which is a new disambiguation page that I created. - Richardcavell 23:13, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

:Sorry for the accidental deletion of this page.  I restored it seconds afterwards. Regards,  23:14, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

== Ethanol fuel energy balance ==

I noticed you added the afd to the page I just spun off from Ethanol fuel. I am quite surprised why you did that, especially since I am still working on it. Perhaps it was an automated procedure, but the page is hardly a personal essay. It just hasn't been wikified into a full article of its own. This was properly noted in the comments.

If it were an automated action, perhaps you would like to look into your code. If it were a conscious action, perhaps you would like to look around before jumping to conclusions. --Rifleman 82 23:18, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

:OK, fair comment.  The article does read as an essay at the moment and it would benefit from some attention, as you say it is currently receiving.  I wouldn't take offence as to my opinion on the content as-it-stands.  Now that I know it is to be improved rather than left alone my concerns are allayed. The  tag can be removed, if required.  23:28, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

your deletion was flagrantly arbitrary. did you even watch the documentary, or perform a google? the wiki:bio guide is far from the gospel truth, and even if i did adhere to it, the article could have stood. Chensiyuan 15:00, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

20 seconds is what you took for you to delete an article without blinking. i have been waiting for more than 5 minutes for a reply. this does not look right. Chensiyuan 15:06, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

:Not arbitrary - WP:BIO#Deceased_people asks ""Has the person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in the specific field?"" This is something that the article doesn't answer.  Your question to me predicates knowledge of the subject.  The article should provide the information in order that an understanding of the individual's notable status doesn't rest on also having seen a documentary.  If the facts in the article are present and complete then the question need not arise and notability will be clear from the biographical details.  15:07, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

::it is people like you who believe in your own hype that many wikipedians, seasoned ones or new, find frustrating to contribute to anything. the article doesn't answer everything the guidelines dictate, simply because the writing of one is an ongoing process. it is unrealistic to expect a single person to complete the writing of a full article in one seating. Chensiyuan 15:13, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

My motivation is not egotistical, it was merely an answer to the above question posed in WP:BIO.  I agree that to expect a full biography in one terminal session is an unrealistic objective.  That is why Sandboxes exist or are created, in order to preserve articles-in-progress from deletion until they are released. Your twenty-second comment above did not demonstrate my arbitrary or mercenary behaviour, rather it is indicative of the time required to read the article-as-presented.   15:22, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

: Agh! I was trying to move that information out of Glass#Behaviour_of_antique_glass.  Copying the information was the very idea.  I was doing it pursuant to a suggestion made by another user that (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Glass#But_.2Ais.2A_glass_a_liquid.3F_Don.27t_ask_wikipedia_apparently....) that the section on 'glass as a liquid' be spun off as a seperate article, following the Summary Style principle.  Go on then: enlighten me on the procedure for carrying off that kind of maneouvre.  --Danward 23:16, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

Look - can I have my article back and some sort of protection against this happening again.  Pursuant to a suggestion made by a user on the Talk:Glass page that the section on 'glass as a liquid' was getting too long and should be spun off as a seperate article (on the Summary Style principle) I was trying to move that information into a seperate article.  Otherwise - enlighten me on an appropriate procedure for going about doing what I was trying to achieve before it was all deleted. --Danward 15:47, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

===Istanbul Pogrom TO BE RE-WRITTEN===
I am afraid the user Damac is a lier as he is Greek and does have a Greek POV. This article is full of lies and propaganda and the usage of the word pogrom is used to incite racial hatred. peopel should not use Wikipedia for there own racial sensitivities. Wikipedia is not here for such hooliganism. Though as more Greeks inflitrate the international satge - such as tennis - even hooliganism will become prevalent there. I will do my own objective research on this issue and changes will be made. I take serious issue with many disputed events that are being recorded here as historical FACT. Or apart from ""not being"" a Greek is Damac a learned historian, too? 

I will also bring forth reasons for the riots, which are not made clear, such as retaliations for the Greek governmental perscution of Thrace Turks, where they cannot praticse their religion, women kidnapped, raped and forced to change their names and religion [http://www.armory.com/~thrace/bibl/bib1.html].

Greece has been taken many time to the European court of human rights on this matter. I will prepare  an article on these issues. It is time that the truth really was written. 

I am sick to death when people hijack Wikipedia for their own bigotry and prejudices.

Enough is enough. 82.145.231.79 03:08, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

:Merhaba, User:82.145.231.79

:First of all, I'm not Greek, but am from Ireland. Secondly, I am an historian and hold a Ph.D. in history. What are your qualifications?

:There is nothing in that article that has not appeared in the Turkish press and there are a number of Turkish articles listed in the sources section. 

:For your information, I am researching the history of Ottoman mosques in Greece and think it is a disgrace how these buildings have been neglected by the Greek authorities.

:Feel free to make any changes to the article in question as you see fit. I will review each one for its merits. 

:Best, --Damac 09:23, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

Nothing you have ""created"" has appeared in any Turkish articles. The sources you have used are at best second-rate and you have copied and pasted to create an false impression of the riots. It just stinks of bigotry and nothing else. You fail to take in factor the events before and after and the reasons why the uprisings happened. You make it sound as though Turks just did it for fun. Half of the so-called ""witness"" stories are fabricated, forced by the Orthodox church upon certain people to badmouth the Turkish government. People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.

Oh, by the way I am British, an assistant professor at Nottingham University. If you are so interested as you claim in the state of the mosques, I would be more concerned with the state of the people in Western Thrace. Or do you find Greek life more valuable? 

I am sorry but people like you who try to calmly hijack Wikipedia for your bigoted aims frankly disgust me. Writing that it is a pogrom won't make it one or your absurdities any more real. 

I find it laughable that you are getting all the Greeks you can to vote to rename it again. What will this prove? That you are right? Shall I do the same and gather all the Turkish people to vote on it, too? And begin a campaign to get every article of atrocities by the Greeks of Pomaks and Turks in Thrace to be called pogroms? 82.145.231.63 15:51, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

:I'm afraid you've little credibility. If you looked through my edits, you'll see that I have contributed to articles on the minorities living in Greece, including the Turks of Thrace, the Chams, the Pomaks and others. 

:I seriously doubt your academic credentials. 

:I have no wish to debate at the level you have engaged in. You make one false personal attack on me after the other. I am using the proceedures outlined by Wikipedia to resolve this issue.--Damac 16:34, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

FYI Ď†ÎąÎ»Îµ damac - when someone moves an article, like User:Blue sea did, you cen revert it, unless any changes have been made to the original article. By editing the original ""pogrom"" page, you made it impossible for the Blue Sea's edit to be undone without admin intervention. I know that was not your intention, I'm just letting you know for future reference. Sysin 09:45, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

What you say is laughable. I have read your so-called contributions to these articles and then see how you write the article on the events arising in Istanbul. You put it out of context and not into the context of the events that were going on around the world at the time. I REPEAT AGAIN you have used unsubstantiated articles, accounts that were contaminated an dsimply not true, and teh reading of yoru article smacks of bigotry. I REPEAT AGAIN I WILL NOT LET THIS GO and I will make sure that Wikipedia is not used as a platform for people such as yourself - whatever mask of 'intelligence' you choose to hide under is of no consequence. Simply comparing your ""contributions"" to the deprived Islamic minorities of Greece and your ""article"" on the Istanbul riots is enough in my opinion to show where your true loyalitis lie - it is not with Wikipedia or to educate - but merely to vilify. I will take this further.  82.145.231.57 02:53, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

TRYING TO PUT THREATS ON MY TALK PAGE ARE USELESS. You know I have to tell all you Greeks that this type of persecution doesn't frighten me in the least. I am not as used to it say as the poor Turkish women of Thrace that has been continually raped and forced to have their identities changed in Greece simply to be able to get a job...talk about ASSIMILATION - Greeks know it all too well. Nothing you can do will make me cow down. I HAVE AS MATTER OF PRINCIPLE asked people who are favourable to my view to stay away - just to see how many Greeks nationalists would rear their ugly heads. Keep them coming folks - we like to know who you are. 82.145.231.77 23:57, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

===User:LOVELLtheLIONHEART's Suggestions===
I am making some suggestions for amendments to this article - and as such have not carried them out yet. After Damac's motives were questioned about the writing of this article (I added the title below to section off my talk) I suggest it is a relevant article - but needs amendments because it has been written in a subjective point of view (even if he says he has no axe to grind). He obviously has sympathies with certain groups - which is natural - if you check his user page.

1. Firstly it should be made clear on the article that that not only its neutrality but its facts are disputed too - so I would add totallydisputed in place of NPOV.

2. Secondly I would add as a note on the article that word pogrom was used as a concious decision by the writer himself (even though this seemingly goes against using wikipeadia as an original source in that he is putting his own slant on his research - yes the definition Wikipedia holds of a pogrom might with argument catch this in its net - but what do all the sources say) and that both Greek sources and Turkish sources and English ones for that matter do not use the word pogrom. We must not forget that this article might be used by people as verifiable sources - so merely adding the reason in a talk page is not sufficent in my opinon.

3. Thirdly it has to be put in historical context, that goverment of 1955 was close to fascisim in the sense that Arabic was also outlawed and that the religion was trying to be reformed - with the ""call to prayer"" in mosques sung in Turkish. But the government was a response BY THE PEOPLE THAT VOTED THEM IN to international events around them - and one can also assume that Greek provocation from Athens (as in Cyprus) was rife. What was Athens situation like in 1955?

4. Fourthly, both sides of the events must be told. Unfounded accusations have been made against the Orthodox Church I feel, and these need to be cleared up. 

5. Fifth point - Using Mehemt Ali Birand's article as a ""source"" for everything said above is obviously misleading when M.A Birand does not mention any deaths or casualities. I believe in Damac's good intention in that he did not intendingly mislead. I think it just shows that he came to this article he wanted to create with a certain point of view and just found evidence to back it up. I am going to guess (and forgive me if I am wrong) but he probably didnt't even read M.A. Brand's article and just thought the initial paragraph was enough - if you follow the link you'll see that you have to be a member to read the full article.

But once these are cleared up this could become a strong article to help inform and educate bothsides. 82.145.231.132 11:09, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

:Would you mind coming out of the woodword and revealing who you are. I don't engage in discussion with persons anon.--Damac 13:29, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

I don't have a username. Do I need to get one for you to talk wÄ±th me on this matter? I want to make these changes but am dicussing first? Or do you want my real name? Do you need an email contact? Please let me know. 82.145.231.132 23:48, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

I just noticed you've added me as a sock puppet for Blue Sea? Can I ask what led you to this conclusion? 82.145.231.132 23:48, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

I am not the user Blue Sea and if this is the way you write your articles and try and prove your points my discussion stands that amendments should be made to yoru article. I could come from the smae area and same provider as Blue Sea - I do not know. Though I did ring up my internet provider and you are incorrect on one score. It does not have to be the same Internet account. But I didnt want to register until I had tried out Wikipedia is all. You accusations are unbiased - though I don't blame you taking into account the recent attacks on you personally. I have checked all the sockpuppets you mention and it seems that Blue Sea is clever enough to change his IP completely at some intervals? Why are not then all the sockpuppets you have listed the same? [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia:Suspected_sockpuppets_of_Blue_sea] Check one that begins with 200. Is it not possible that Blue Sea is using false IP's or something and you really doN't know his IP? Else how could they be varied? However, my suggestion still stand and I do want this discussed. Please don't avoid the issues I have raised. If you continue to block debate then I don't see how this is going to be resolved. In my other two posts I just copied and past my other post's signature. I will not do so this time. 82.145.231.200 12:46, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

:As I said, I'm not going to waste my time debating with people who couldn't be bothered to take the one minute it takes to register with Wikipedia. By all means check out Wikipedia and see what it is all about. Once you've made up your mind on whether you want to join, then get back to me. Otherwise, I'm not interested. 
:I believe I am right on the ISPs. I've had similar problems with Irish nationalists. Maybe I got it wrong with the 200 ISP, but what about the others?

Thank you for the advice Damac. I've signed up and I will continue this on the talk page of the relevant article. LOVELLtheLIONHEART 18:49, 3 February 2006 (UTC)


=== Damac and others are Hijacking Wikipedia and Abusing Powers to promote a Greek POV all across any Turkish related articles ===

* Other perpertrators and vandals include (and yes administrators can be vandals too with secret agendas) 
*Sysin and as User:Globo
*Delirium
*Latinus et al
*Michalis Famelis

All these 'people' have their dirty fingers in tankering with any Turkish related articles tryng to create a racially motivated bias against Turks. And getting such a biased and incorrect and inconclusive article as the Istanbul pogrom as a feature article at Wikipedia merely proves how many of these people there are hijacking Wikipedia. 

Here is Latinus asking Damac at his talk page whether they could ""get away"" with deleting some pro-Turkish sites. 

Sysin has attempted to change the articles on Greek genocides agains Western Thrace minorities.

Globo likes to reword Turkish genocide by Greeks as uprisings - but when Istanbul pogrom is written it becomes a featured article. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Turkish_genocides_by_Greeks&action=history]

Michalis pretends to be so moderate, when he is acting as their voice of reason - in a good cop bad cop routine. He actually defending Damac when his ""research"" on the pogrom and his usage of a Turkish source was actually MISREPRESENTED AND FALSE. Talk:Istanbul_Pogrom

These people and their contribitions should be checked and observed closely. 62.177.208.126 21:58, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

:I don't usually respond to these kind of attacks, but I would like to point out that
:*a) I am not Greek
:*b) I am not involved in the ""tankering"" of Turkish-related articles to create racial bias.

:I'd also like to point out that User:Blue sea's contributions need to be checked. Take for example his The Chios Massacre, which he created on 25 January using his sockpuppet User:Steven Banks and which he redirected to Chios three days later using an anonymous sockpuppet. Why? In his original article he claimed that the Chios Massacre involved thousands of Turkish victims, which is, simply, completely in contradiction of historical fact. 

:I did not respond to Latinus' request to have the articles on the massacres of Turks in Greece deleted because I believe and know that massacres took place. In fact, I have been planning to write about these incidents. 

:User:Blue sea, you'll get no where if you continue to engage in personal attacks and to write sloppy articles. You are your and your causes own worst enemy!--Damac 11:09, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

Then surely this proves the agenda of Latinus and that there are ADMINISTRATORS actually defending filth like him. Now people should realise why I have lost faith in Wikipedia - people who dress up lies that sound like truth and walk the line and do things in the rules cam just about write what they want - and once on Wikipedia they are creating their own history for ulterior motives. My second posting for listing these users was initially because of Latinus' request to have these articles speedily deleted. Blue sea 23:42, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

===Reply to Damac===
I'll keep my English plain and simple so that you can understand it this time Damac. 

1. You keep saying how you have Turkish friends and keep quoting little Turkish phrases at me - and it reminds me of that saying ""I am not racist I have may black friends.""

2. Secondly I am not embarrassed by anything. I actually first wanted that list to encompass all the so called genocides to show that it wasn't some Empire going to different regions of its lands and killing races for the fun of it it was quelling uprisings at a time when people were wanting their independence - because I believe their is a difference between putting down uprisings as genocide and labelling (as you did) a event in the 1950's as a pogrom which obviously tries to hark back to the Jewish pogroms in Eastern Europe and Russia. The context that happened in was a time when that government - fascist or no - was the first governement of Turkey to be actually democratically voted in. You use a language and events which are disputed, and yet you say it is NPOV. I disagree. Doesn't matter how many times you say ""hello"" or ""good evening"" to me in Turkish. I had more problem with the word pogrom and with some of the supposed events that took place.

3. That went in by accident and the minute I realisd this I re-directed it to the Chios article. 

4. Yes I am foul mouthed and angry - because I've had enough. So you are Catholic - that's fine - and I do not profess anything - the history around me shows how thanks to the Catholic religion Orthodxy almost went extinct and most Greeks see the Pontif as the devil himself - Greeks told me this as hey guess what I have many Greek friends, too - even if I do call the ones in here idiots.

5. And yes I believe you should contribute to those articles to make up for what you did with the istanbul article. Unkowningly you have done a great mis-service there. And hey if the true object of building up your contributions list with improving those articles is to prove me wrong about your tinkerings with Turkish articles then still go for it. But I will be interested to see if you call these pogroms or geneocides or use words such as displacement and riots. After all it really all is in the inetpretation isn't it? Blue sea 05:31, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

::1. I know what I am and what I'm not and I certainly don't have to prove it to the likes of you. 

::2. The 1955 Pogrom was not an act of genocide and I never said that. I suggest you look up the meaning of the word pogrom in any reputable English dictionary, Wikipedia or Wictionary and you will read that a pogrom is a campaign of violence orchestrated by a government against a minority. That is what happened in 1955. It was not an uprising - these are planned by groups against a government - nor was it a riot, which is a spontaneous outburst of violence against authority. To call what happened in Istanbul in 1955 the ""September Uprising"" or the ""September Events"" is so completely miss the significance altogether. 

::I'd also like to remind you that the head of the same democratically elected government was executed on the orders of a Turkish court.

::3. Utter BS. A look at the editing history shows that your claim ""That went in by accident and the minute I realisd this I re-directed it to the Chios article"" is a lie:

It's so ironic, but thanks to you there now is another article out there describing a massacre of Greeks by the Ottoman military. Are you now part of this Greek cabal?

::4. I was baptised a Catholic, but like you, profess no faith. 

::5. I will contribute articles on the massacres of Turks and Muslims in Greece during the War of Independence out of service to Wikipedia and not to you. I owe you nothing. I will name the articles according to the information I find on these incidents - I'm certainly not going to make my mind up in advance and will research my articles throughly.--Damac 08:00, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

::1. I know what I am and what I'm not and I certainly don't have to prove it to the likes of you. 

* I only ask for proof on the progom, your character is impotant to you - for me it holds no significance.

::2. The 1955 Pogrom was not an act of genocide and I never said that. I suggest you look up the meaning of the word pogrom in any reputable English dictionary, Wikipedia or Wictionary and you will read that a pogrom is a campaign of violence orchestrated by a government against a minority. That is what happened in 1955. It was not an uprising - these are planned by groups against a government - nor was it a riot, which is a spontaneous outburst of violence against authority. To call what happened in Istanbul in 1955 the ""September Uprising"" or the ""September Events"" is so completely miss the significance altogether. 

* For starters it is still disputed whether that government did actually do so - and if this is the only reason for stating it is a progom then it is at best flimsy - because as you say Menderes was used as a scapegoat by a very quick trial where proof was scare - they used him as a scapegoat becuase his ideas were radical and extreme - he wanted to ban arabic for example and made the call to prayer in Turkish. I still hold pogrom is wrong. I havent missed the significance - I am actually in the picture as a person who has direct knowledge, someone like you who is of Irish descent and breathing the Athens air shouldn't discount what I have to say. I do not profess to be an expert on the potato famine or why the Irish were segregated along with the blanks in America - but you with your little smattering of Turkish (enough not even to bother to read Mehmet Ali Birand's article but just quote it as a source) seem to think you know Turkish political history so well. Plus - if it is even labelled as a pogrom in Greek history - who are you to rewrite it on the basis that there is questionable evidence that their might have been government involvement?

I also took to question the statements (which you have changed since then) about men and women being raped - did you check your sources and then change it solely to the rape of women - and where where men forcibly circumscied in the streets? I have been asking for these sources for ages. Blue sea 10:08, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

::I'd also like to remind you that the head of the same democratically elected government was executed on the orders of a Turkish court.

* Thank you for reminding me. Blue sea 10:08, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

::3. Utter BS. A look at the editing history shows that your claim ""That went in by accident and the minute I realisd this I re-directed it to the Chios article"" is a lie:

* This is your danger and your biggest flaw Damac - this proves how dangerous assumption is. From just that list you have interpreted my actions my THOUGHTS and my intentions with no other colloboration. Is this how you write your articles? No other side of the story? Any evidence can be used to justify any argument if you use enough words.  I reverted because I was actually going to rectify on that page - then it dawned on me there might be an article and when I found out there was I redirected. Blue sea 10:08, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

* You really dont understand what I write do you? I didnt say do it for me - though my attacking you might now have you in a defensive stance to pad out your contribution list a little in a different way - but I said do it for Wikipedia and try to make up for that shameful article. And sorry to say you do make up your mind in advance - and I am really worried if closed minded people like you are contributing to Wikipedia. As I say I await with interest to see how you write the murders of Turks in Thrace - I am sure there will be no pogroms or geneocides mentioned will there?

213,"== Arvanite Alliance ==

I've never even heard of such a party! I read the article and it says it was formed in February 2006 which means it was formed in the last 15 days. I watch greek political (leftist) websites, such as the athens indymedia but not the merest mention of a new ""anti-nationalism"" movement has been made, and judging from the fact that any anti-nationalistic news is usualy quickly mentioned in such websites, I think this could be either a hoax, wishful thinking or a realy marginal party that was formed like yesterday by previously unheard of people. Apart from that the article is in need of a complete rewrite as it contains much nonsense, but I would hesitate to touch it at least not before I hear that such a party really exists. -- Michalis Famelis 11:34, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

:I think we'll just have to wait and see if the user provides any sources. If he doesn't in a few days time I think it would be sendible to nominate all three article for deletion:
#The party is most probably fictional.
#I've never heard of a distinct Arvanitic flag.
#The image of the supposed flag is copyrighted and links nowhere...
:Beautiful day today in Athens, isn't it? Long Live the Attic Sun! --Michalis Famelis 12:37, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

Hello Damac, I hope everything is going ok for you. I think we can move on to AfDing these articles. It's been like a week and the original poster has not provided any sources. Googling ""arvanite alliance"" still doesn't pop anything up, so I think it must have been fiction. Anyway if there actually exists such a party, someone will eventually re-post the whole thing. AfD? --Michalis Famelis 00:02, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

:Hi, just noticed you two had been discussing this earlier. I've made both AfD's now, after the same user also tried to revert Arvanites and created a POV fork of it at Arvanit. Lukas  12:09, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

== Ministry of Culture ==

Kalimera! From what I understand, during the Junta no parties existed formally, in the spirit that ""all the Nation is united so no parties are needed"". In the same time I don't think that there was any ""Junta Party"" so as to have an one party state. I think this is more close to the latin american juntas: no political parties, just a group of officers and a bureaucracy. Possibly, you could place them under a ""Regime of the Colonels"" allegiance; I think that would be the most accurate. I'll ask my father and tell you tomorrow for sure, though. Btw, it seems I'll have to award you a barnstar or something, you do an awful lot of work! --Michalis Famelis 11:05, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

== Election box templates (reply to question aksed long ago!) ==

Hi.  I found the question you left at Template talk:Election box about a month ago, asking about how to get the election templates to work properly.  In case you're still interested, what you need to do for a candidate whose party has metadata stored for it (like Independent Republican (Ireland)) is to use  for that candidate, and then in the ""party"" field, put (for instance) Independent Republican (Ireland) without the .  I've just fixed Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency) in this way.  --RFBailey 00:28, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

==Greek election results==

Thank you for the piece of advice. I'm obsessed with greek politics and the greek history, in general, including the elections. Nevertheless, I face two major problems: a) lack of time, b) limited knowledge of the english language (my native language is greek).  
I'll try to contribute as much as I can, because I regard the registration of all modern election results as something exciting and useful. --Yannismarou, 20 February 2006

== Dioceses in Ireland ==

Hi Damac, I noted your request for comments on the Irish Wikipedians' notice board regarding dioceses in Irland. I am active in this regard as well at the German language edition of the Wikipedia, see for example :de:Liste der ErzbischĂ¶fe von Armagh. In my opinion, it is most reasonable to include both post-reformation lists, i.e. Roman-catholic bishops and bishops of the Church of Ireland, in one article for two reasons:
* Both office holders see themselves as successor of the pre-reformation bishops. This means that if we would split the lists into two articles, we would either get some redundancy by having the pre-reformation bishops in both articles or we would violate the NPOV if we restrict one of the two articles to the post-reformation bishops.
* In the early post-reformation time, things get rather complex as quite a number of bishops are acknowledged by the Church of Ireland and the Roman-catholic church at the same time. In these cases, the bishops had surrendered their bulls of provision as required but they were also quick to assure their loyalty to the pope. And the interregnum of Mary adds to the problem.
The real challenge, however, regarding the lists of Irish bishops is not this problem but the trouble of obtaining correct lists for early medieval times, i.e. the time before the synode of Rath Breasail in 1111. The lists that are to be found on other web pages are (as far as I have seen) entirely unreliable. This means that each of these lists require quite some research of scientific papers, all the annals and other primary sources.
Best regards, AFBorchert 19:08, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

== Athinganoi ==

Hi Danac. The small bits I know about these 'Athinganoi' come from here and there. Quite funny, they seem to be associated with the Cathar heressy. What is the official Greek stance on them? Or are they just hidden under the carpet (a la greque)?

http://www.vlachophiles.net/conf.htm Balkan Borderlands and endless paths
'The ascent of Islam and the collapse of the Persian and Byzantine empires pushed various oriental ethnic groups into Europe, among these were the Roma/Gypsies. They drew their different names from the people that they came into contact with, names such as ""Arami"" (Armenians, pagans), ""Faraontseg"" (crowd), ""Bohemians"" (from Bohemia), ""Tartars"", ""Gypsies"" (Egyptians), ""Saracens"" (Arabs), ""Athinganoi"" (Tziganes). This last name derived from ""Cingar"", a hypothetical Hindo-Aric population, and afterwards took the meaning of ""pagan"", ""untouchable"", relating to the Athinganoi heresy of Cathar origin, historically it defined the Roma ethnic community. The ethnonym ""Roma"" (from the Greek term ""Rhomaios"", denomination for the inhabitants of the Roman Empire and for the Christians of Byzance until the collapse of the Empire) used with ""Sinto"" (the Roma from the Germanic area) and ""Kalo"" (the Roma from the Hispanic region) defines a transfrontier ethnic community with its own language and culture' [12]

:People convicted for such offences face similar if not tougher sentences in other countries. It has nothing to do with Greece being a paradise or not.
:I'm not sure what the point of this is. I'm aware of the story and the person in question. I'd also remind you that depending on who says it and in what context, the term Paddy is pejorative and  disparaging term.

== IRA page ==

Hi, I hope you don't object to my moving the IRA and the treaty to its own article. The reason was that the IRA article was far too big as it was. I was also very dissatisfied with the content of the early part of the article, which I have also edited considerably. Perhaps you would like to look over the changes?
Jdorney 20:41, 12 March 2006 (UTC)
:No, not at all. I'm glad that someone is showing dedicated interest in improving the articles on Irish republicanism in general and that we're moving away from the FearĂ‰ireann Prinz Joachim school of new historical myth. I had more time for this in the past but am somewhat busy with other things on Wikipedia these days.
:You might have noticed that I moved some of the pages, replacing hyphens with en-dashes. It might seem a minor issue, but hyphens (-) are used to link words and people's names. En-dashes (â€“), however, are used to suggest a time span, or a distance (the Dublinâ€“Galway road), etc. You'll find more info on this at Dash. --Damac 22:23, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

Interesting. I admit I wasn't aware of the distinction before now. The only problem with the move is that all the links and some double re-directs go to the hyphenated pages. Thus the ""what links here"" page is much smaller than it should be. Out of curiousity, how would one write an en dash as opposed to a hyphen?

Re the IRA pages, I felt that the earlier ones were somewhat selective in the information included. I wouldn't describe myself as Republican but there are NPOV issues with only telling the Free State/1980s revisionist version of events. The problem now is that all the IRA pages except the ones for the newer dissident groups are too big and are spawning daughter articles, some of which are themselves too big now!

All the best,
Jdorney 23:17, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

== Reality check for  Damac ==

I don't want to sound again offensive to ultra-sensitive ears (BTW there is an Irish Whiskey brand called 'Paddy' officially registred as such and which can be bought here in London from Waitrose if I'm not wrong, see posting below) but I disliked the way you vandalized my contributions to the article about the religious minorities in Greece. There's something grotesque about you expats living in Greece, trying to curry favour with the host nation by forever showing off and proving that you are on 'their' side (shared prejudices included). But then, you live in Greece and IT starts to show. Slowly and surely, simply living there  makes one sink. To live in such a country inevitably renders you onto a brainwashed creature. It's just a matter of time. Your country of adoption is, in my humble opinion by far the least civilized country in Europe. Despite the mild climate, it's a very very tough place to live in. I'm not envying you really.

== Hyphens and dashes ==

Thanks for the note, but I really prefer using simple keyboard characters wherever possible, and the MoS states ""A single spaced hyphen - like this. This is considered an en dash rendered in the same ""typewriter"" style as the double hyphen for em dashes, above"" is an acceptable alternative to an en dash.  However, I've got no objection if you wish to change them. Warofdreams talk 00:18, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

== First National Assembly of Greece ==

The ""Provisional Regime of Greece"" (Î ĎÎżĎĎ‰ĎÎąÎ˝ĎŚ Î ÎżÎ»ÎŻĎ„ÎµĎ…ÎĽÎ± Ď„Î·Ď‚ Î•Î»Î»Î¬Î´ÎżĎ‚) and the Temporary Constitution of Greece (Constitution of 1822) are exactly the same thing. Maybe we should take care of that. 
Dimitrios Ypsilantis participated in the First Assembly and that's how he became president of the legislature. Alexandros Ypsilantis did not participate, because after his defeat in Romania he was very depressed and disappointed.
Yannismarou 10:30, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

:I don't think they are the same thing. The Assembly was a gathering which met from December to January. The Consitution was a document passed by the Assembly on one of the day's that it sat. Saying that they are the same thing would be like saying that the present contitution of Greece is the same as the parliament which passed it. There is a distinction.--Damac 11:04, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

You missed my point. I do not say that the Assembly is the same thing with the Constitution. It is not and you did very well creating a new article. What I say is that the ""Provisional Regime of Greece"" (Î ĎÎżĎĎ‰ĎÎąÎ˝ĎŚ Î ÎżÎ»ÎŻĎ„ÎµĎ…ÎĽÎ± Ď„Î·Ď‚ Î•Î»Î»Î¬Î´ÎżĎ‚) is another name for the Temporary Constitution of Greece (Constitution of 1822). To be more specific: 
One thing: The National Assembly 
Another thing: the ""Provisional Regime of Greece"" (Î ĎÎżĎĎ‰ĎÎąÎ˝ĎŚ Î ÎżÎ»ÎŻĎ„ÎµĎ…ÎĽÎ± Ď„Î·Ď‚ Î•Î»Î»Î¬Î´ÎżĎ‚)= the Temporary Constitution of Greece (Constitution of 1822), adopted by the National Assembly. 
If you see the present structure of the article you created and compare it with my remarks, I think you'll understand what I mean.
Yannismarou 15:52, 9 April 2006 (UTC)
:Sorry, I completely misread your comment. My apologies. My Greek isn't great and I appreciate your advice. 

:We should explain in each article that the official name in Greek is Î ĎÎżĎĎ‰ĎÎąÎ˝ĎŚ Î ÎżÎ»ÎŻĎ„ÎµĎ…ÎĽÎ± Ď„Î·Ď‚ Î•Î»Î»Î¬Î´ÎżĎ‚ or Provisional Regime of Greece. (Is this is the most literal translation?)

:This pattern should be continued for the remaining articles. I saw somewhere that the 1823 version was officially known as the Law of Epidaurus and the Fifth National Assembly of Troezen adapted the Political Constitution of Greece which was the same name used for the 1832 Constitution.--Damac 08:54, 10 April 2006 (UTC)
